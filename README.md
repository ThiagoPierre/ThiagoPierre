#  Hello There <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
 I'm Thiago, aka colxa
 
 I'm a student developer from Brazil, currently working for Pitang Agile IT. As an intern, i'm currently working on automating tests using SpecFlow and Selenium, but my real 
 passion is on back-end and front-end developing. You can find me on [![LinkedIn][1.2]][1].

 ## Hobbies :muscle:
 Apart from coding, i really love bodybuilding competitions(yes, the ones with guys in swimsuits), and i also love music! I play a lot of instruments, like the guitar or the bass.
 
 ## Technologies and Tools :technologist:
 As of now, i'm doing the RocketSeat Ignite course, making my way through ReactJS and Elixir. I've been studying React for a while, so it's the technology i'm most confident on.
 I also have some projects using NodeJS and Express for the back-end, and some using Angular for the front-end too. I'm starting Elixir now, and i'm really excited about it!
